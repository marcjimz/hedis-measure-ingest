      "expected_answer": "AMM stands for Antidepressant Medication Management. It assesses the percentage of members 18 years and older with a diagnosis of major depression who were treated with antidepressant medication and remained on the medication for at least 84 days (12 weeks) for the acute phase treatment, and at least 180 days (6 months) for the continuation phase treatment.

A 45-year-old woman would NOT meet the BCS measure requirements because she is below the minimum age of 50 years required for the measure. The measure specifically targets women aged 50-74 years.",

The denominator for CDC includes members aged 18-75 years as of December 31 of the measurement year who had a diagnosis of diabetes (type 1 or type 2) during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year.

      "expected_answer": "For the CDC (Comprehensive Diabetes Care) HbA1c control indicator, good control is typically defined as HbA1c <8.0%. An HbA1c result of 8.2% would NOT meet the numerator for good glycemic control (HbA1c <8.0%), though it would count toward the numerator for HbA1c poor control (>9.0%) being false. The patient had the required HbA1c test performed, which satisfies the HbA1c testing component, but the value indicates suboptimal control.",

Additional exclusions include members in hospice, receiving palliative care, or with advanced illness and limited life expectancy.

A first prenatal visit at 15 weeks gestation (second trimester) would NOT meet the timeliness component for first trimester prenatal care, as it exceeds the 13-week cutoff for the first trimester.",

The numerator includes children from the denominator who had six or more well-child visits with a primary care physician (PCP) during their first 15 months of life.

A member who took medication from June 1st through August 30th has completed 90 days of continuous treatment, which exceeds the 84-day requirement.

A 'new' prescription means the member had no ADHD medication fills in the 120 days prior to the IPSD.

      "expected_answer": "For the COL (Colorectal Cancer Screening) measure, a colonoscopy is valid for 10 years. A colonoscopy performed in 2018 would still be valid for the 2024 measurement year (6 years later), as it falls within the 10-year look-back period (measurement year plus 9 years prior). Therefore, NO, the 72-year-old woman does NOT need another colorectal screening test to meet the COL measure in 2024 - her 2018 colonoscopy satisfies the numerator requirement.",

The key difference is the duration: 84 days for acute phase versus 180 days for continuation phase. Both rates use the same denominator (members with major depression newly treated with antidepressants), but measure different treatment duration thresholds aligned with clinical practice guidelines.",

The exam must be sufficient to assess for diabetic retinopathy. Acceptable documentation includes: (1) evidence of retinal or dilated eye exam with results documented, (2) a negative retinal or dilated eye exam result, (3) evidence that the member is being treated for diabetic retinopathy, or (4) a photograph of the retina showing evidence of diabetic retinopathy.

      "expected_answer": "NO, a member receiving hospice care should be EXCLUDED from the CDC (Comprehensive Diabetes Care) measure denominator. Members in hospice or receiving palliative care are excluded from the measure because the focus of their care has shifted from disease management and prevention to comfort care and quality of life. These exclusions recognize that aggressive diabetes management and screening may not be appropriate or aligned with the member's goals of care in the hospice setting.",

      "expected_answer": "BCS-E (Breast Cancer Screening - ECDS) is an alternative measure to standard BCS that uses the NCQA Electronic Clinical Data Systems (ECDS) methodology for data collection. While both BCS and BCS-E assess the same clinical concept (breast cancer screening in women aged 50-74), BCS-E allows for electronic data extraction directly from electronic health records (EHRs) and other electronic sources, rather than relying on administrative claims data. BCS-E may provide more comprehensive capture of screening events and reduce documentation burden, while maintaining the same age group (50-74 years) and screening criteria (mammography within 27 months).",

For the August 15 IPSD: the September 1 visit (17 days later) MEETS the Initiation Phase requirement (within 30 days). The December 20 visit (127 days later) is within the continuation period, but only ONE visit is documented in the continuation phase, while TWO are required. Therefore, this meets the Initiation Phase numerator but does NOT meet the Continuation and Maintenance Phase numerator (needs one additional visit between days 31-300).",

      "expected_answer": "For the CBP (Controlling High Blood Pressure) measure, the diagnosis of hypertension is based on ICD-10 diagnosis codes or documentation of hypertension in the medical record - there is not a specific blood pressure threshold for diagnosis inclusion in the denominator. However, for the NUMERATOR (adequate control), the blood pressure must be <140/90 mmHg based on the most recent blood pressure reading during the measurement year.
